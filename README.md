# iBeaconer
Windows software to create an iBeacon broadcast

Software to create and emulate a Bluetooth iBeacon in Windows 10. 
Requires a database of names, UUIDs, plus their respective major and minor pairs in a file compiled within the final executable.
However this can be overridden in the source code and hardcoded in for smaller datasets, or manually entered into the GUI.

Could do with some bugfixes and more direct access to the bluetooth drivers for more responsive beacon creation.
